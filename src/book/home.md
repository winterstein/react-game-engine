I smile and tell them that the teacher seems OK, and it was nice to meet my class.

Mom: Thank you James. Cassie, maybe you could be more like your brother. {player.connection.mom += 1}

Cassie: (angry) Fine, I'll just go grow a dick. (leaves)

Cassie: (smiling) Dreich and dreary!

James: (smiling) Desultory and dismal!

Mom: (annoyed) Stop it!

Cassie: See - even James agrees.
