# Diary of a Schhol Astronaut(x) Detective

## Sunday 

Mom: (happy) Today's the day! Fresh country air here we come!

Today is the **worst** day ever. We are leaving home, and my school, and all my friends...      
and in fact we're leaving everything, to go live in a field in the middle of nowhere.

The first challenge is loading the car. We did not realise how much stuff we had until we tried to pack it up. Mom tried to use the move as an excuse to get us to throw out some of our toys. But we swore to defend them. Then Dad tried to get Mom to throw out some of her clothes. 

Dad: You can't even fit into half of them. 

The resulting explosion was heard three blocks away.

So in the end we compromised by putting most of our things in storage to be delivered once we're settled in. 

Mom: Okay, pick what you want to bring now.

??

A van and two burly men came round. They threw all our stuff in their van, like it was just so much junk. 

(doodle, lamp, vase, etc being thrown in)

They handed Dad a ticket and drove off.

Mom: Don't lose that. 

And then, without further ado, we are off. Their really should have been more ado: A speech by the mayor; weeeping friends... But it's just the click of seatbelts, the clunk of car doors, and the rumble of the engine. 

(drive, city, field, cows skull, field)

After a while, the drifted off to sleep. I had the weirdest dream. ??

Dream or vision - meet the shifting world child 
I am omega, or ùúî for short.
see the guardian angel ??


We arrive. I had hoped the new home might be something special. That to make up for it being out in the sticks, it might be a mansion, 
with a pool, a games room, a TV room, and a trampoline. My hopes are dashed. Then the pieces are trodden on. Our new house is a dump. The paint is peeling. There is a smell of damp. But I do not discover the true horror of the situation until a few minutes later.

Cassie: Listen RatFace, you-touch-my-music-you-die.    
She says this without looking up from her phone.    

There are only two bedrooms.   
So I have to share with my sister.   
Aargh.   
Aaaaaaargh.  

Meet my sister.

## Monday
1st day of school. 

(walk into school, kids ahead chatting...

The important thing when starting school is: Choose carefully where you sit. This is a key factor in both your social position and grades. You want to avoid (a) idiots who will drag your grades down, and (b) social lepers who will follow you around like a bad smell. Last year I arrived late and got hit with both -- the hotly uncontested seat between "Moron" Murphy, and Farty Fraser. Murphy doesn't know the difference between arithmetic and asthmatic. He would ask for an inhaler to do sums, and one time when Susie Jeffries _did_ have an asthma attack, he started shouting "Calculator! Calculator!". Farty Fraser -- well let's just say he _earned_ his nickname. Our group projects were not a success:

So I arrive on time, to choose my seat wisely. 

Except, you don't know who anyone is, so it's a blind choice.

Where will you sit? Table A B C D

Next, is the hard bit. I have to talk to someone. They're all strangers today could be great friends in waiting.

2. Trade on your mysterious origins. School kids, like any predator, pick on the weak. And a lonely new kid is the weakest creature around. But: gossip is hard currency, and the only person with any on you is: you. This gives you an exotic air of mystery. It will wear off fast, so you've got to cash it in straight away.
At lunch, walk tall like you're the King of Cool, and sit down at the popular kids table. They may snub you tomorrow, but you'll have set your initial status high instead of low.

3. Talk to someone. Loneliness is a deadly disease for school kids. If you look lonely, other kids may fear it is contagious, and avoid you -- which is a vicious circle. Fortunately every class has some nice kids. But they don't exactly where badges saying "nice kid" or "I like your favourite band too". So talk to everyone like you're a chat show host.

4. Get onto the current thing, whatever it is. Football stickers, TV shows, a catchy dance video -- If there's a trend people are talking about, then now is not the time to be fussy: Share their enthusiasm!

What were those kids saying about a new app?
