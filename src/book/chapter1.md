## Sunday 

### Leaving

Mom: (happy) Today's the day! Fresh country air here we come!

Today is the *worst* day ever. We are leaving home, and my school, and all my friends...      
and in fact we're leaving everything, to go live in Rosbreck, which is a field in the middle of nowhere.

The first challenge is loading the car. We did not realise how much stuff we had until we tried to pack it up. Mom tried to use the move as an excuse to get us to throw out some of our toys. But we swore to defend them. Then Dad tried to get Mom to throw out some of her clothes. 

Dad: You can't even fit into half of them. 

The resulting explosion was heard three blocks away.

So in the end we compromised by putting most of our things in storage to be delivered once we're settled in. 

Mom: Okay, pick what toy you want to have in the car.

### Packing

A van and two burly men came round. They threw all our stuff in their van, like it was just so much junk. 

(doodle, lamp, vase, etc being thrown in)

They handed Dad a ticket and drove off.

Mom: Don't lose that. 

### Driving

And then, without further ado, we are off. There really should have been more ado: A speech by the mayor; weeeping friends... But it's just the click of seatbelts, the clunk of car doors, and the rumble of the engine. 

(drive, city, field, cows skull, field)

After a while, I drifted off to sleep. I had the weirdest dream.

### Dream

I'm in a garden. It's a nice garden. There are flowers and butterflies of every colour. I'm seated in a chair facing two most peculiar people. One is a friendly looking old man who smiles at me. The other is a girl with long dark hair, who looks off to the side, as if the whole garden is just *too* boring. The first person is - is now a middle aged Indian lady still smiling. And then he, she, they are a young dark skinned boy, then a Chinese girl and, and... I never see them do it, but they keep changing. However, their smile remains the same, and I somehow know it's all one person.

(garden)

Morphing Person: Welcome to The Garden. Do not be worried. This is a safe place.

Morphing Person: I am omega, or ùúî for short. I have summoned you here for a purpose. You are a Wayfarer and it is time for your skills to awaken.

Omega: There is something going on in ??. 

Moody Girl: Can I go yet? There's no point explaining anything to him before he's had a first crossing.

### Driving

(car) 

The dream ends, and I wake up in the car.

Cassie: You drool in your sleep. It's disgusting.

We arrive. I had hoped the new home might be something special. To make up for it being out in the boondocks, it should be a mansion, 
with a pool, a games room, a TV room, and a trampoline. This is... not the case. My hopes are dashed, and then the pieces of hope are trodden on.

### Arrive

Our new house is a dump. The paint is peeling. There is a smell of damp. But I do not discover the true horror of the situation until a few minutes later.

(explore house)

Bedroom:
	Cassie: Listen RatFace, you-touch-my-music-you-die. /She says this without looking up from her phone./

	There are only two bedrooms.   
	So I have to share with my sister.    
	Aargh.    
	Aaaaaaargh.   

	Meet my sister.

## Monday

1st day of school. 

(walk into school, kids ahead chatting...

new app everyone's playing

)

The important thing when starting school is: Choose carefully where you sit. This is a key factor in both your social position and grades. You want to avoid (a) idiots who will drag your grades down, and (b) social lepers who will follow you around like a bad smell. Last year I arrived late and got hit with both -- the hotly uncontested seat between "Moron" Murphy, and Farty Fraser. Murphy doesn't know the difference between arithmetic and asthmatic. He would ask for an inhaler to do sums, and one time when Susie Jeffries _did_ have an asthma attack, he started shouting "Calculator! Calculator!". Farty Fraser -- well let's just say he _earned_ his nickname. Our group projects were not a success:

??painting with pong

So I arrive on time, to choose my seat wisely. 

Except, you don't know who anyone is, so it's a blind choice.

Where will you sit? Table A B C D

Next, is the hard bit. I have to talk to someone. But they're all strangers. I suppose some of them could be great friends in waiting. 

What this new app?
