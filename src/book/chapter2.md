### 1st day of school

Cassie is late getting up, so I walk into school alone.

I pass small groups of friends chatting.

The important thing when starting school is - Choose carefully where you sit. 

This is a key factor in both your social position and grades. You want to avoid (a) idiots who will drag your grades down, and (b) lepers who will follow you around like a bad smell. 

Last year I arrived late and got hit with both -- the hotly uncontested seat between "Moron" Murphy, and Farty Fraser. 

Murphy doesn't know the difference between arithmetic and asthmatic. He would ask for an inhaler to do sums, and one time when Susie Jeffries _did_ have an asthma attack, he started shouting "Calculator! Calculator!". 

Farty Fraser -- well let's just say he _earned_ his nickname. Our group projects were not a success.

So I arrive on time, to choose my seat wisely. 

Except, you don't know who anyone is, so it's a blind choice.

Where will you sit?

Next, is the hard bit. I have to talk to someone. But they're all strangers. I suppose some of them could be great friends in waiting. 

...What this new app?




## That night

That night I have a weird dream. I'm not in the dream - it's like I'm watching a show on TV. And it's a horror show.

One of the girls from school has a starring role.

(some house)

Mother: Don't stay up late. It's school tomorrow.

Eilidh: Yeah, I'll just be a minute.

Infected Phone: (glows weirdly)

Eilidh: Heh, I thought I'd switched that off.

Infected Phone: (the glow intensifies)

Eilidh: What the...?

There is a flash of light - and then silence. A bad kind of silence. If silence could have a flavour, this one would taste of sulphur.
