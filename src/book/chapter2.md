### 1st day of school

Cassie is late getting up, so I walk into school alone.

I pass small groups of students and catch bits of conversation.

Katie "Chatty Girl": Did you see the village notice board? Another cat has gone missing.

Mina "Serious Girl": Oh no. Whose cat was it?

I walk on.

David "Boy With Glasses": Have you tried the app?

Donald "Athletic Boy": No, I have to focus on my training.

David "Boy With Glasses": But you *have* to install it. *Everyone's* on it.

### The classroom

The important thing when starting school is - Choose carefully where you sit. 

This is a key factor in both your social position and grades. You want to avoid idiots who'll drag your grades down, and losers who'll follow you around like a bad smell. 

Last year I arrived late and got hit with both -- the hotly uncontested seat between "Moron" Murphy, and Farty Fraser. 

Murphy doesn't know the difference between arithmetic and asthmatic. He would ask for an inhaler to do sums, and one time when Susie Jeffries _did_ have an asthma attack, he started shouting "Calculator! Calculator!". 

Farty Fraser -- well let's just say he _earned_ his nickname. Our group projects were not a success.

So I arrive on time, to choose my seat wisely. 

Except, you don't know who anyone is, so it's a blind choice.

Where will you sit?

Next, is the hard bit. I have to talk to someone. But they're all strangers. I suppose some of them could be great friends in waiting. 

...What this new app?


"Oh Katie, you've got an apple. Swap?"

"Sorry Evie. Red's got chocolate - she'll not trade. Try Green."


Hey you're the new boy from the city. We're -

 - Oh don't tell him our names, See if he can guess.




## That night

That night I have a weird dream. I'm not in the dream - it's like I'm watching a show on TV. And it's a horror show.

One of the girls from school has a starring role.

Mother: Don't stay up late. It's school tomorrow.

Eilidh: Yeah, I'll just be a minute.

Infected Phone: (glows weirdly)

Eilidh: Heh, I thought I'd switched that off.

Infected Phone: (the glow intensifies)

Eilidh: What the...?

There is a flash of light - and then silence. A bad kind of silence. If silence could have a flavour, this one would taste of sulphur.
