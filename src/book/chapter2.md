### 1st day of school

Cassie is late getting up, so I walk into school alone.

I pass small groups of students and catch bits of conversation.

Katie "Chatty Girl": Did you see the village notice board? Another cat has gone missing.

Mina "Serious Girl": Oh no. Whose cat was it?

I walk on.

David "Boy With Glasses": Have you tried the app?

Donald "Athletic Boy": No, I have to focus on my training.

David "Boy With Glasses": But you *have* to install it. *Everyone's* on it.

I walk on. The school looms larger -- an old victorian building, like a cross between a church and a prison.

Soon I am in the playground, and then in the building.

We had a letter from the Head Teacher so I know where I'm going - the Senior 2 classroom, left after the school doors.

### The classroom

The important thing when starting school is - Choose carefully where you sit. 

This affects both your social position and your grades. You want to avoid idiots who'll drag your grades down, and losers who'll follow you around like a bad smell. 

Last year I arrived late and got hit with both -- the hotly uncontested seat between Moron Murphy, and Farty Fraser. 

Murphy didn't know the difference between arithmetic and asthmatic. He would ask for an inhaler to do sums. 

The one time when Susie Jeffries _did_ have an asthma attack, he started shouting "Calculator! Calculator!". 

Farty Fraser -- well let's just say he _earned_ his nickname. 

Our group projects were not a success.

So I arrive on time, to choose my seat wisely. 

Except, I don't know who anyone is, so it's a blind choice.

Where should I sit? 

|Table A|Table B| 

{if |Table A|} {mytable=A}

{if |Table B|} {mytable=B}

Next, is the hard bit. *Talking* to someone. But they're all strangers. 

I suppose some of them could be great friends in waiting. Maybe.

|Hello|You lookin at me?|...|

#### {if mytable = A}

Katie: (happy) Hello - You must be new here. I'm Katie.

#### {if mytable = B}

David: Wotcha.

### Lesson - History

History Teacher: Good morning class. This term's subject is the history of America.

History Teacher: The American War of Independence started in 1775. 

History Teacher: Let's see what the new boy knows. James!

History Teacher: - Why did the American colonies rebel? They had a famous slogan.

|No bling for the King!|No taxation without representation!|Not for riches but for freedom!|

#### {if |No taxation without representation!|}

History Teacher: That's right. 

{player.knowledge += 1}

#### {if |No bling for the King!|}

History Teacher: Bling? No, it was 'No taxation without representation'

#### {if |Not for riches but for freedom!|}

History Teacher: No, that sounds like Scotland's Declaration of Arbroath. It was 'No taxation without representation'

#### {end:if}

History Teacher: The American colonies were angry at paying tax to Britain when they had no say in the British parliament.

History Teacher: They set up their own democratic meetings.

The lesson rolls on.

"Oh Katie, you've got an apple. Swap?"

"Sorry Evie. Red's got chocolate - she'll not trade. Try Green."


Hey you're the new boy from the city. We're -

 - Oh don't tell him our names, See if he can guess.




## That night

That night I have a weird dream. I'm not in the dream - it's like I'm watching a show on TV. And it's a horror show.

One of the girls from school has a starring role.

(some house)

Mother: Don't stay up late. It's school tomorrow.

Eilidh: Yeah, I'll just be a minute.

Infected Phone: (glows weirdly)

Eilidh: Heh, I thought I'd switched that off.

Infected Phone: (the glow intensifies)

Eilidh: What the...?

There is a flash of light - and then silence. A bad kind of silence. If silence could have a flavour, this one would taste of sulphur.
