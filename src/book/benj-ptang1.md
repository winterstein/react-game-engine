# Fasta Benj and PTang PTang

# Lost in Navigation

Benj: I have sold all my fish! And got many good things.

Benj: ...a pocket knife. Now I must get some pockets... 

Benj: ...and a camel teddy saying 'I ‚ô• Omnia'. 

Benj: Now it is time to go home. But which way is home?

Benj: I shall pray for guidance...

Benj: (praying) Oh Great PTang PTang! 

PTang PTang: Yes, my child.

Benj: Which way should I sail?

PTang PTang: Ah yes.

Benj: You who know everything. Please guide me!

PTang PTang: Yes I know everything.

PTang PTang: ...But maybe sometimes I forget. Just you know, little things.

PTang PTang: ...Like what number comes after 3. Or, er, the way home.

PTang PTang: I will ask one of the other gods - One of my lesser servants that is.

PTang PTang: Let me pray to Om...

Om: What is it now? Finding your way at sea? Navigate by the stars, you fool.

PTang PTang: Benj, you should navigate by the stars.

Benj: Thank you oh Great One.

Benj: (confused) ...But there are no stars?

PTang PTang: But Om, there are no stars.

Om: You have to *wait* until *night*, you frog-brained idiot.

PTang PTang: Not frog. Newt. I is *newt god*.

Narrator: ...Later that night...

Benj: (praying) Oh Great PTang PTang - Which star should I follow?

PTang PTang: For home... hm... I think it must be the big one. There.

Benj: The crescent shaped one?

PTang PTang: Yes! It is so much bigger than the others.

Narrator: ...After sailing for a while...

Benj: I think we are lost.

PTang PTang: Why?

Benj: I followed the big crescent star. And now the boat is not on water but on hot sand. And we are stuck.

Benj: (worried) What shall I do?

PTang PTang: Oh. I have, er, divine duties. I shall be back soon.

PTang PTang: Let me ask Om...

Om: What is it now?

PTang PTang: We may be lost.

Om: What do you mean *we*?

PTang PTang: Can you help? 

Om: ...

PTang PTang: My followers will offer many lettuces to you.

Om: OK, OK. I will give you a map. Relaunch your boat, then steer east (which is that way, by the way)...

Om: ...and you will enter the wild swamp, which leads to your home swamp. But it won't be easy. There are sharks, and snakes. 

Om: -- and some of them *eat newts*.

PTang PTang: (gulp)

PTang PTang: Fasta Benj!

Benj: A vision from the great god!

PTang PTang: Here is a map.

Benj: (praying) Lo - He guides me home!

Benj: (worried) Wait, what is this drawing? It looks like a shark.

PTang PTang: Yes, there may be sharks. Try to avoid sharks. Have faith!

PTang PTang: ...and luck. Please have luck too.

## Home

Benj: (praying) We have made it home! Let me give thanks to the god!

PTang PTang: Yes -- praise be to me. You should really make me a sacrifice!

PTang PTang: ...of a dozen live flies!

Om: ahem.

PTang PTang: ...and many lettuces.
